    <div class="content">
        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>Throughout ancient times, people from various parts of the world traveled to India for several reasons:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Trade:</strong> India was known for its rich resources, such as spices, textiles, and precious stones. Traders from distant lands like Rome, Greece, and China came to India to acquire these valuable goods.</li>
            <li><strong>Culture:</strong> The cultural richness of India, with its arts, music, and literature, attracted scholars and artists. India's diverse cultural heritage was a major draw for those seeking to experience and learn from different traditions.</li>
            <li><strong>Religion:</strong> India was the birthplace of major religions like Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism. Pilgrims and seekers of spiritual wisdom traveled to India to visit sacred sites and learn from renowned spiritual teachers.</li>
            <li><strong>Learning:</strong> Ancient India was home to some of the world's earliest universities, such as Nalanda and Takshashila. Scholars from around the world came to study subjects like philosophy, medicine, astronomy, and mathematics.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Geography</h2>
        <p>India's geographical features and the routes used to reach the subcontinent played a crucial role in facilitating travel:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Silk Road:</strong> This ancient network of trade routes connected the East and West. It allowed traders, pilgrims, and adventurers to travel overland through Central Asia to reach India.</li>
            <li><strong>Maritime Routes:</strong> The Indian Ocean trade network was another significant route. Ships from Arabia, Africa, and Southeast Asia sailed to Indian ports, bringing goods and travelers.</li>
            <li><strong>Himalayas and Northern Plains:</strong> The natural barriers and fertile plains provided both protection and sustenance to travelers. The passes through the Himalayas were used by invaders, traders, and pilgrims.</li>
